                        <p>Under the Reykjavik Maritime Museum’s website, we will produce a satellite webpage showcasing the “Sea Women” exhibit. In order to highlight the rich scope of the exhibit’s history and the unusually high representation of sea women in the area, the website will have an interactive timeline covering a history from the mid-900s to the present day, and will include photos, videos, interviews, oral histories, and biographies. 
                        </p><p>   The interactive timeline will allow users to click on a year to get excerpts and voices of women telling their story about the industry during that year. Additionally, there will be a bar for how many women were in the fleet every year - actual numbers and the percentage of female versus male representation in the industry will be shown on these bars. The videos are to include interviews in the form of oral histories. The bulk of the interviews will be conducted with men and women from Iceland - those who are working or who have worked in the maritime industry & those who have not. Interviews with Margaret Willson will include what motivated her to conduct this research and her experiences with workers in the industry. 
                        </p> <p>These interviews would showcase people’s experiences with women in the workforce and how things have changed (or not) over the centuries. In conjunction with the recorded interviews, we hope to showcase some of the women who have worked at sea. Photos of the women will be displayed along with small biographies. The biographies will include their relationship to the industry, their tenure, and some brief social information (birth date, where they lived, how many children they had, etc.). Finally, excerpts from Margaret Willson’s book will also be showcased on the website. Any anecdotes about accidents or jokes will be sure to catch the reader’s interest.</p>
